### Criteria for selecting sports to analyze

Discussion of criteria for sports that will be examined and why
* timed, and where the only criteria is time
* either not head-to-head (i.e., time trial: athletes are not on the course at the same time) or nominally head-to-head (e.g., swimming pool, where athletes are in different lanes; see assumptions blow)
Olympics and World Championships

Examples of sports and events in Winter and Summer Olympics that meet these criteria and sports that are excluded

### Assumptions

Discussion of assumptions made in evaluating these events
* athletes are putting in maximum effort
* best athletes are present
* athletes are maximally prepared
* athletes are not using information about their competitors’ performance to gauge their own effort

### Sources of Edge

List of various sources of edge
* Performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs)
* equipment and materials

In this discussion, briefly touch on several examples of each, which will be discussed further below.

### In-depth vignettes on edge in sports

How small are the differences? Use many examples from sports. This will end up coinciding with visualizations on website.

PEDs
* What are reported/expected improvements in performance?

Advances in swimsuits
* History since 2000
* Speedo Lazer suit in late-2000s; records broken; banning for 2010; 
* This will end up coinciding with a visualization on website.

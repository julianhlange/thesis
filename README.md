## Abstract
The Winter and Summer Olympic Games are quadrennial sporting events that bring together
the world’s most elite athletes. While the differences in endorsement and other financial
opportunities available to gold medal winners and fourth place finishers are massive,
the differences in athletic performances are vanishingly small. Because the margins are so
small, athletes and their national sports federations are continuously acquiring different
sources of edge, from advances in training methods, nutrition, and equipment to illicit
performance enhancing substances. Some of the allowed sources of edge have the effect of
changing the parameters of a sport and resulting in world records. This thesis aims to
demonstrate, by sport, how small the differences between the very top athletes and the
rest of field are. In examining a wide range of Winter and Summer Olympic sports, including
skiing, luge, swimming, and track, I find sport-specific ranges from 0.1% to 0.5%. These
findings are discussed in the context of examples from Olympic and World Championships events.


## Introduction

## Data and Methods


## Results

### Criteria for selecting sports to analyze

Discussion of criteria for sports that will be examined and why
* timed, and where the only criteria is time
* either not head-to-head (i.e., time trial: athletes are not on the course at the same time) or nominally head-to-head (e.g., swimming pool, where athletes are in different lanes; see assumptions blow)
Olympics and World Championships

Examples of sports and events in Winter and Summer Olympics that meet these criteria and sports that are excluded

### Assumptions

Discussion of assumptions made in evaluating these events
* athletes are putting in maximum effort
* best athletes are present
* athletes are maximally prepared
* athletes are not using information about their competitors’ performance to gauge their own effort

### Sources of Edge

List of various sources of edge
* Performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs)
* equipment and materials

In this discussion, briefly touch on several examples of each, which will be discussed further below.

### In-depth vignettes on edge in sports

How small are the differences? Use many examples from sports. This will end up coinciding with visualizations on website.

PEDs
* What are reported/expected improvements in performance?

Advances in swimsuits
* History since 2000
* Speedo Lazer suit in late-2000s; records broken; banning for 2010; 
* This will end up coinciding with a visualization on website.

### Analysis of specific sports events

Miniscule differences at top.
Distribution of distribution in differences between 1st and 2nd or 1st and rest.
Look at different sporting events.

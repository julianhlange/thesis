# On and Beyond the Edge
### Visual Stories of Winning Margins in Elite Sports

### Julian H. Lange

## Abstract
Olympic Games and World Championships showcase the world’s most elite athletes.
While the differences in endorsement and other financial opportunities available to
medal winners and fourth place finishers are massive, the margins of victory in elite sports have become vanishingly small.
This series of interactive visualizations examines three stories from – and beyond – the edge.
First, situated in the 2018 Winter Olympic Games, viewers are invited
to test hypothetical scenarios in which subsets of athletes improve their performance by thin margins.
The second visualization highlights a story from competitive swimming, where advances in swimsuit development
effectively changed the parameters of the sport.
Finally, viewers can relive the men's singles luge event at the 2018 Winter Olympic Games. Instead of
two hours of luge coverage, the animation runs the top eight athletes side-by-side on the track.

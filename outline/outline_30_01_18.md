I'm visualizing... sports feats
because I want to show... the extent of physical abilities
in order to ... convince people to celebrate human athletic accomplishments


## 1. ATHLETIC RECORDS AND "EDGE"

### Define athletic feats in speed, strength, distance, longevity, and records
1. Records in speed, stength, and time, and/or in titles, victories
2. Instances where differences between 1st place and 2nd place are miniscule
3. Instances where differences between 1st place and 2nd place are massive
4. Using records to defining dynasties and all-time greats
5. Records set in older age groups, such as Masters

### Sources of primary data
IAAF (track and field); FINA (swimming), International Weightlifting Federation; FIS, FIL, and ISU (winter sports); World Association of Masters Athletes (track and field for age categories)

### Potential issues
1. Different sports are comparable in different ways. For example, some track and field records are relatable for many readers because most people can relate to running, jumping, throwing.
Conversely, records in head-to-head sports (e.g., tennis), judged sports (e.g., figure skating), or more obscure sports (e.g., speed skating), are not as comprabaly measureable to many readers,
even those who practice those sports.
2. Do readers care? How to make records relatable?


## 2. INTEGRITY IN SPORTS

### Defining each sport
1. What are the rules that define each sport?
2. How have those definitions evolved and/or become codified over time?
3. Examples of sports that have undergone specific moments in their definitions, e.g., 2009 changes to rules in swimming materials and design

### Doping in sports
1. What is the cost of doping to the sport itself through reputation?
2. What are examples where a doped athlete cost another athlete a model?
3. What are the costs in endorsements etc to losing athlete?
4. What are the reasons given for data suggesting doping offense?... cheating, medication, physiological
5. Why are some doping offenses tolerated? e.g., in track and field, athletes often come back after ban

### Sources of primary data
Use rules for various governing sports bodies
For doping, focus on specific time period or specific Olympic Games; use data from IOC


## 3. MONEY IN SPORTS

### Athlete earnings
1. How have the salaries of professional leagues increased over time?
2. How have earnings of professional athletes in tennis, golf, Olympic sports evolved over time?
3. How well compensated are different sports?

### Team earnings for major professional sports teams - a lucrative business
1. Four major US leagues over time
2. European soccer league

### Betting in sports
1. How have numbers changed over time (in the past n years)?
2. Use season statistics to make model defining –– after, for example, a quarter of the season –– which team will vs will not make the playoffs.
Could use 10 years of data from NHL or NFL or MLB as a training set, then use model to see how well prediction works for other years and other sports.

### Sources of primary data
NFL; NHL; MLB: NBA salary reports from teams and/or leagues; reported earnings from professional associations such as ATP, WTA, FIS; revenue reports from European soccer teams
Betting data: TBD

### Potential issues
1. Salary structures can be opaque
2. Question of how other forms of compensation (e.g., federation salary, endorsement deals) affect what an athlete would otherwise demand/need to earn
3. Where to find data on sports gambling


## 4. AUDIENCE(S)
Reader: Sports enthusiasts and general interest readers
How: Read as a news story with numbers and data in order to celebrate human accomplishment, not activism or to incite action
Ask of audience: Possibly interactive in the sense that readers will be able to place themselves and their own abilities into context
Aim: Reader learns how astounding these records are by providing examples that (sprinting; long jump >29 feet; speed of marathon runner carried for over 2 hours)
